In this directory, we provide the student UD syntax annotations from the classroom annotation exercise that originated the Old English UD Cairo data in this repository.

Each file contains all the student annotations for a single Cairo sentence. Each sentence has at least 2 student annotations. 

The following metadata is included for each sentence: ```sent_id```, ```cairo_sent_id```, ```text```, ```annotator```

```sent_id``` is the id of the sentence in the current file.

```cairo_sent_id``` is the id of the sentence in the final Cairo UD data file provide in the repo. This is the same for all sentences in a single file.

```text``` is the text of the Old English sentence. This is the same for all sentences in a single file.

```annotator``` is the identifier for the student who annotated the sentence. The identifier indicates the annotator's experience level with UD, either "experienced" or "novice", and provides an alphabet character identifier (e.g., novice_a).
